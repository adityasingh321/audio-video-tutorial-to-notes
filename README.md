# Audio to Notes

A web application that captures audio from your browser, transcribes it using a local Whisper server, and converts it into organized notes using Google Gemini 1.5 Flash.

## Features

- Capture audio from your browser from either **microphone** or **system audio**.
- Real-time audio recording with start/stop controls.
- **Local Whisper server for efficient audio transcription.**
- **Structured note generation using Google Gemini 1.5 Flash.**
- **Email delivery of transcriptions and notes** with configurable PDF attachments.
- **PDF generation for both full transcription and structured notes**, with options to include either or both in the email.
- Modern, clean, and responsive UI built with Material-UI.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Python (for the Whisper server)
- `ffmpeg` installed and accessible in your system's PATH (required for system audio capture and audio processing).
- Google Gemini API key
- Email credentials (for sending emails, e.g., Gmail App Password)

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd audio-to-notes
    ```

2.  Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install # in the root directory
    ```

3.  Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    # Install Python dependencies for Whisper
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd ..
    ```

4.  Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory and add your API keys and credentials:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
    EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_app_password_here # For Gmail, use an App Password
    ```

5.  Start the backend server (in the `server/` directory):
    ```bash
    cd server
    node server.js
    ```

6.  Start the frontend development server (in the root directory):
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1.  **Enter your email address** in the provided field to receive notes and transcriptions.
2.  Choose between **"Microphone" or "System Audio"** recording. Ensure you grant necessary permissions.
3.  Click the **"Start Recording"** button when you want to begin capturing audio.
4.  Click **"Stop Recording"** to end the session.
5.  The audio will be processed: transcribed by Whisper, notes generated by Gemini, and then queued for email delivery.
6.  **PDF Options:** Use the checkboxes to select whether to include the full transcription PDF and/or the structured notes PDF in the email.

## Important Notes

- Make sure your browser has permission to access your microphone or capture system audio.
- The application works best with clear audio input.
- Keep your API keys and credentials secure and never commit them to version control.
- Ensure your backend server (`server.js`) is running for full functionality.
- If using Gmail, you will likely need to generate an App Password as your `EMAIL_PASSWORD` (check Gmail security settings).
